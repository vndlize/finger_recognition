the background must be smooth for accurate finger counting
maintain a clear and stable background for a few seconds before introducing the hand into the Region of Interest (ROI) frame.

In the resulting frame, hand gestures are identified by counting fingers and tracking fingertip positions. Additionally, a thresholded image of the hand is displayed to enable users to appropriately position the hand within the ROI.
